# Master Thesis
## Sound and Music Computing, UPF
Code used in the context of my master thesis project.
Includes python scripts, a web app/experiment
and a web app/step sequencer.
The web apps were developed using JavaScript and Flask.
The step sequencer was based on [this](http://codepen.io/njmcode/pen/PwaXwB).
