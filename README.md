# Master Thesis
## Sound and Music Computing, UPF
Code used in the context of my master thesis project.
Includes python scripts, a web app/experiment (at the moment can be found in [lefterisstamellos.pythonanywhere.com](http://lefterisstamellos.pythonanywhere.com)) 
and a web app/step sequencer.
The web apps were developed using JavaScript and Flask.
The step sequencer was based on [this](http://codepen.io/njmcode/pen/PwaXwB).
